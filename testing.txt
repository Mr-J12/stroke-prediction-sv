1) Very low risk — young, healthy
Data (enter in sidebar):

gender: Female
age: 22
hypertension: No
heart_disease: No
ever_married: No
work_type: children
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 75.0
bmi: 20.5
smoking_status: never smoked
Why: Young age, no comorbids, normal glucose and BMI, non-smoker → expected very low probability.

2) Low risk — adult, small risk factors
Data:

gender: Male
age: 40
hypertension: No
heart_disease: No
ever_married: Yes
work_type: Private
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 95.0
bmi: 24.0
smoking_status: never smoked
Why: Middle age but no major conditions; probability slightly higher than sample 1 but still low.

3) Mild risk — overweight + former smoker
Data:

gender: Female
age: 54
hypertension: No
heart_disease: No
ever_married: Yes
work_type: Self-employed
Residence_type: Rural
avg_glucose_level: 105.0
bmi: 29.5
smoking_status: formerly smoked
Why: Increased age, higher BMI and former smoking raise risk modestly.

4) Moderate risk — hypertension present
Data:

gender: Male
age: 62
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: No
ever_married: Yes
work_type: Govt_job
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 120.0
bmi: 28.0
smoking_status: never smoked
Why: Hypertension + older age and elevated glucose produce a moderate probability.

5) High risk — heart disease + smoker
Data:

gender: Male
age: 68
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: Yes
ever_married: Yes
work_type: Private
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 140.0
bmi: 30.5
smoking_status: smokes
Why: Multiple major risk factors (age, hypertension, heart disease, active smoking, high glucose/BMI) — expect a high probability.

6) Very high risk — older, multiple severe risks
Data:

gender: Female
age: 75
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: Yes
ever_married: Yes
work_type: Never_worked
Residence_type: Rural
avg_glucose_level: 180.0
bmi: 33.0
smoking_status: formerly smoked
Why: Advanced age + cardio/metabolic disease and very high glucose → very high predicted probability.

7) Critical-risk scenario (edge-high)
Data:

gender: Male
age: 82
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: Yes
ever_married: Yes
work_type: Private
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 240.0
bmi: 36.0
smoking_status: smokes
