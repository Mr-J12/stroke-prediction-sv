1) Low risk — adult, small risk factors
Data:

gender: Female
age: 40
hypertension: No
heart_disease: No
married: Yes
work_type: Private
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 100.0
bmi: 28.0
smoking_status: never smoked
Why: Middle age but no major conditions, very low risk of stroke 

2) Mild risk — overweight + former smoker
Data:

gender: Female
age: 54
hypertension: No
heart_disease: No
married: Yes
work_type: Govt_job
Residence_type: Rural
avg_glucose_level: 110.0
bmi: 26.0
smoking_status: never smoked
Why: Increased age, higher BMI and former smoking raise risk modestly.

3) Moderate risk — hypertension present
Data:

gender: Male
age: 66
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: No
married: Yes
work_type: Govt_job
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 135.0
bmi: 32.0
smoking_status: smokes
Why: Hypertension + older age and elevated glucose produce a moderate probability.

4) High risk — heart disease + smoker
Data:

gender: Male
age: 65
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: No
married: Yes
work_type: Private
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 140.0
bmi: 32
smoking_status: formerly smokes
Why: Multiple major risk factors (age, hypertension, active smoking, high glucose/BMI) — expect a high probability.

5) Very high risk — older, multiple severe risks
Data:

gender: Female
age: 70
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: Yes
married: No
work_type: Private
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 220.0
bmi: 38.0
smoking_status: never smoked
Why: Advanced age + cardio/metabolic disease and very high glucose → very high predicted probability.

6) Critical-risk scenario (edge-high)
Data:

gender: Male
age: 80
hypertension: Yes
heart_disease: Yes
married: No
work_type: Private
Residence_type: Urban
avg_glucose_level: 200.0
bmi: 35.0
smoking_status: formerly smokes
